# The Insurwave QA Automation Assessment 

The purpose of this assessment is for you to showcase skills and knowledge by showing your approach to writing automation tests.  Use any tools or technology you prefer to complete the task.
 
Please include all the good practices that would be normally used during the day-to-day testing practice. Please feel free to use any libraries, or patterns that feel right for you.

Complete as many scenarios as possible, for the next stage interview it is not necessary to complete all four scenarios.

During the interview session, all the completed scenarios will be demoed, reviewed, and discussed. Please make sure you have access to the computer to do the demo by sharing the screen.

For every scenario, please prepare a separate commit/pull-request showing incremental work.

## Scenario 1: API Automated Testing

Write a test automation script to test a RESTful API endpoint https://www.weatherapi.com/ using the free account

* Implement automated tests for at least 2 endpoints which Include GET and POST requests and verify response status codes, data correctness, and data type.

Note: Handle error cases gracefully.

*  Modify your API tests to include parameterisation for different test data, so that you can iterate test data from a data store (CSV/Excel or any data store of your choice)


## Scenario 2: Data Validation

* Implement data validation in your above tests. Verify the API response against a schema or JSON schema (e.g Use any library or tool for schema validation)

 
## Scenario 3: UI Automated Testing

Write a UI automation script to test the website https://www.saucedemo.com/

* Automate at least 2 test scenarios, such as login, product search, or adding an item to the cart along with implementation of assertions to verify expected UI elements. You should demonstrate test setup and teardown methods.

Note: Handle synchronisation issues effectively.

* Implement the Page Object Model for the e-commerce website and refactor your previous UI tests to use the POM structure.

 
## Scenario 4: UI Frameworks

* Create a modular framework for your UI tests and implement error handling, logging, and report generation.

* The framework should be reusable for other UI test scenarios.

Note: UI test to run on multiple browsers (e.g., Chrome and Firefox) and the ability to configure the target browser options in a configuration file


## Nice to Haves

* Integrate your tests with a test reporting tool of your choice

* Ability to run Performance tests

* Generate detailed reports with test results, screenshots, and logs.
