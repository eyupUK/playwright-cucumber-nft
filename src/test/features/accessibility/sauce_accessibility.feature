Feature: Accessibility Testing For SauceDemo
  As a quality engineer
  I want to ensure key pages of SauceDemo meet accessibility standards
  So that users with disabilities can use the site effectively

  # Acceptance Criteria
  # - Axe scan reports zero Serious or Critical violations on: Login, Inventory, Cart, Checkout (Info/Overview/Complete), and Login error state.
  # - Pages under test load successfully (HTTP 200) before scanning.
  # - Scans are executed after the page is visually ready (post navigation and key DOM actions).
  # - Report artifacts are generated (Allure and cucumber HTML/JSON) for audit.
  #
  # Technical Requirements
  # - Use axe-core Playwright integration (version aligned in pom) and Chrome with stable driver.
  # - Public site https://www.saucedemo.com is reachable from the test environment.
  # - Headless run is supported via configuration if desired.
  # - Allure output goes to target/allure-results;
